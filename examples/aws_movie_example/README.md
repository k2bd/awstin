# AWS Movies Database Example

This is a set of examples from AWS's ['Python and DynamoDB' getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GettingStarted.Python.html). They have been updated to use `awstin` instead of `boto3`, with the exception of the first example, creating the table, which is out-of-scope for `awstin`.

The data model used through is in `models.py`
